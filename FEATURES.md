## Source Overview

# Overview

This pnpm monorepo, built with TypeScript, provides a comprehensive Diagnostic ERP system. Its purpose is to streamline operations for diagnostic centers, covering patient management, billing, lab operations, inventory, accounting, and AI-driven insights. The system supports both web and self-contained Windows desktop applications. The business vision is to modernize diagnostic center workflows, improve efficiency, and elevate patient care through intelligent automation.
