# CARE DIAGNOSTICS — MASTER SYNOLOGY MIGRATION, PACS, ERP & IMAGING PLATFORM AUDIT

**Date:** 7 June 2026
**Auditor:** Replit Agent (Architecture Review)
**Scope:** Complete infrastructure, production-readiness, and migration audit
**Constraint:** Read-only analysis. No code changes. No deployments. No database modifications.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Care Diagnostics operates a comprehensive TypeScript/pnpm monorepo ERP with **111 database schema files**, **40+ frontend pages**, and **30+ API route modules**. The system is currently hosted on Replit (cloud) with a PostgreSQL database, while PACS (Conquest) runs on a local Windows PC. The goal is to migrate entirely to a Synology DS1522+ NAS.

**Critical Finding:** Production database has **51 missing tables** compared to development, and **3 missing columns** in `clinic_settings` (ollama-related fields), causing ERP UI failures when code expects columns the database doesn't have.

**Recommendation Priority:**
1. **URGENT:** Fix production database schema drift before any migration
2. **HIGH:** Plan PACS parallel operation (Conquest + Orthanc) for zero-downtime migration
3. **MEDIUM:** Synology Docker deployment is already supported by existing `docker-compose.yml`
4. **LOW:** AI/Ollama should remain on Windows or move to a dedicated GPU workstation

## PART 1 — DEVELOPMENT VS PRODUCTION AUDIT (NON-RADIOLOGY ERP)

### 1.1 Database Schema Comparison

**Evidence:**
- Development schema files: **111** (`lib/db/src/schema/*.ts`)
- Development tables: **277** (per live query)
- Production tables: **226** (per live query)
- **Missing in production: 51 tables**

#### Critical Non-Radiology Tables Missing in Production

| Table | Module | Impact if Missing |
|---|---|---|
| `echo_regional_walls` | Echo Cardiology | Cannot record regional wall motion |
| `hanging_protocols` | PACS Viewer | Cannot save viewer layouts |
| `hl7_integration_settings` | HL7 Integration | Cannot configure HL7 feeds |
| `hl7_messages` | HL7 Integration | Cannot track HL7 message history |
| `measurement_history` | Patient Metrics | Cannot track longitudinal measurements |
| `modality_routing_map` | DICOM Routing | Cannot route studies by modality |
| `mwl_entries` | Modality Worklist | Cannot generate worklist entries |
| `radiologist_macros` | Radiology | Cannot save radiologist macros |
| `radiologist_shortcuts` | Radiology | Cannot save radiologist shortcuts |
| `technician_workflow` | Technician | Cannot track technician workflow |
| `upload_files` | File Uploads | Cannot track uploaded files metadata |
| `viewer_presets` | PACS Viewer | Cannot save viewer presets |

#### Column Discrepancy in `clinic_settings`

**Evidence:**
- Development: **105 columns**
- Production: **102 columns**
- Missing in production: `ollama_base_url`, `ollama_model`, `ollama_local_only`

**Impact:** The application performs `SELECT *` on `clinic_settings` at startup. When the code (compiled with 105-column expectations) queries a database with only 102 columns, PostgreSQL throws `42703` (undefined column) errors, causing **500 Internal Server Errors** on all ERP screens that load clinic settings.

**Root Cause:** Schema was updated in development without running a corresponding migration on production. The `ollama_*` columns were added for AI integration but the production database never received the `ALTER TABLE` statements.

### 1.2 API Route Completeness

**Evidence:** 30+ non-radiology route files in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/`

**Finding:** All non-radiology pages are implemented. Navigation is permission-based via `Layout.tsx` with `ERP_NAV_ORDER` and `staffSession.ts`.

### 1.4 Settings / Configuration Completeness

**Evidence:** `clinic_settings` table has 105 columns covering:

- Branding (name, logo, colors, fonts)
- Contact (address, phone, email, website)
- Billing (GSTIN, print copies, paper size, QR code)
- Portal (enabled, heading, welcome message, booking)
- Payments (Razorpay, PayU, PhonePe, BharatPe, Cashfree, ICICI)
- Kiosk (enabled, payment gateway)
- UPI (QR image, VPA, enabled)
- Security (LAN-only login, allowed IPs, FIDO2, session timeout, lockout)

- Footer (service, follow-up, promotional, accreditation, WhatsApp)
- Scan (auto-crop, auto-rotate, archive, padding, JPEG quality, max width)
- AI (Ollama base URL, model, local-only)

**Missing in production:** `ollama_base_url`, `ollama_model`, `ollama_local_only` — causing ERP crashes.

### 1.5 Environment Variables

**Evidence:** From codebase audit and `app.ts`

| Variable | Required | Purpose | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection | Set in both environments |

### 1.6 Menu / Navigation Items

**Evidence:** `Layout.tsx` defines the navigation structure:

**Top-Level (flat):**
- Billing Desk, My Daily Summary, Patients, Appointments, Online Bookings, Queue Tokens, Samples, Scan Station, Report Delivery, Reports, Report Generator, Report Hub, Expenses, Accounting, Banking, Books Sanity, Form F, Website Builder, WhatsApp Chatbot, Machines

**Grouped:**
- Billing & Payments: Bills, Due Payments, Payments, Orders
- Staff: Staff Directory, HR Forms
- Settings: General Settings, Radiology Settings, Test Catalog, Outsourced Labs, Outsource Costs, Packages, Inventory, Discounts, Doctors/Referrals, Backup & Replication, System Update

**Finding:** All menu items are implemented with permission-based visibility. No missing items identified.

### 1.7 Features in Dev but Not Production

| Feature | Evidence | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Ollama AI integration | `clinic_settings` missing ollama columns | **HIGH** — causes 500 errors |
| Echo cardiology regional walls | `echo_regional_walls` table missing | Medium — echo reporting incomplete |
| HL7 integration | `hl7_integration_settings` + `hl7_messages` missing | Medium — cannot integrate with external systems |
| Measurement history | `measurement_history` table missing | Medium — no longitudinal tracking |
| Modality routing | `modality_routing_map` table missing | Medium — DICOM routing manual only |
| MWL entries | `mwl_entries` table missing | Medium — worklist generation incomplete |
| Radiologist macros | `radiologist_macros` table missing | Low — productivity feature missing |
| Technician workflow | `technician_workflow` table missing | Low — no technician tracking |
| Upload files tracking | `upload_files` table missing | Medium — file metadata lost |
| Viewer presets | `viewer_presets` table missing | Low — user experience degraded |
| Radiology memory engine | `radiology_memory` + 8 related tables | N/A (radiology excluded) |
| AI model routes | `ai_model_routes` table | N/A (AI excluded) |
| Teaching cases | `teaching_cases` table | N/A (radiology excluded) |
| Radiology annotations | `radiology_annotations` table | N/A (radiology excluded) |
| Teleradiology users | `teleradiology_users` table | N/A (radiology excluded) |

### 1.8 Features in Production but Not Dev

**Evidence:** None identified. Production is a subset of development.

### 1.9 Build/Version Mismatch

**Evidence:**
- Development commit: `ed6bdbce` (June 6, 2026)
- Production commit: Unknown (likely older)
- The production schema is missing tables that were added in recent commits

**Finding:** Production is running older code that doesn't match the current schema.

### 1.10 Deployment Mismatch

**Evidence:**
- Development: Replit workflows (hot-reload, instant)
- Production: Replit Reserved VM (`deploymentTarget = "vm"` in `.replit`)
- Production uses single-process unified serve (`build-deploy.mjs`)
- Docker configuration exists but is not used in production

**Finding:** Production deployment is Replit-specific and cannot be directly migrated to Synology without Docker adoption.

### 1.11 Production-Only Errors

**Evidence:** From deployment logs and code analysis:

1. **500 errors on clinic settings load** — Missing `ollama_*` columns in production
2. **Potential 500 errors on new features** — Any feature that touches the 51 missing tables will fail
3. **401 errors in preview** — Staff auth required (expected, not an error)

### 1.12 Database Drift Summary

| Metric | Development | Production | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tables | 277 | 226 | **-51** |
| Schema files | 111 | 111 | 0 (same codebase) |
| `clinic_settings` columns | 105 | 102 | **-3** |
| Patients | 4 (test) | 3,724 | Production is live |
| Bills | Minimal | 3,615 | Production is live |

**Critical Action Required:**
1. Run `ALTER TABLE clinic_settings ADD COLUMN ollama_base_url TEXT DEFAULT ''`, `ollama_model TEXT DEFAULT ''`, `ollama_local_only BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` on production
2. Create the 51 missing tables (or disable the code that references them)
3. OR: Deploy the latest code that matches production schema

## PART 2 — PACS / DICOM / VIEWER AUDIT

### 2.1 Conquest PACS Status

**Evidence:**
- Configuration: `conquest/erp_notify.lua` — Lua hook that pushes metadata to ERP on image reception
- Inbound endpoint: `POST /api/internal/radiology/studies` (protected by `INTERNAL_API_KEY`)
- PACS IP: `172.16.1.139` (Clinic Windows PC)
- `PACS_PROVIDER` likely set to "conquest" in production

**Assessment:**
- Conquest is **operational** and receiving studies
- Worklist is **receiving studies** (per user report)
- DICOM Puller is **running** on Windows PC

### 2.2 DICOM Puller Status

**Evidence:** Two implementations exist:

1. **DCMTK Pull Agent** (`dicom-pull-agent/`): External Node.js process using `findscu`/`movescu`
2. **In-Process DIMSE Agent** (`artifacts/api-server/src/services/dicom-pull-agent/dimse-agent.ts`): Native Node.js using `dcmjs-dimse`

**Assessment:**
- The DCMTK agent is designed to run on the Windows PC near modalities
- The in-process agent is enabled via `ENABLE_DICOM_PULL_AGENT=1`
- Both are **code-complete** but actual runtime status requires live verification

### 2.3 Weasis Integration

**Evidence:**
- `PACS_VIEWER_TYPE` can be set to "weasis"
- ERP can launch Weasis via URL protocol or direct link
- `EmbeddedWadoViewer` component exists as a lightweight built-in alternative

**Assessment:**
- Weasis is **installed** on Windows PC
- Integration is **configured** but requires live testing

### 2.4 OHIF Status

**Evidence:**
- `OHIF_URL` environment variable exists
- `PACS_VIEWER_TYPE` can be set to "ohif"
- OHIF is **NOT currently installed** per user report
- No OHIF Docker container in current `docker-compose.yml`

**Assessment:**
- OHIF is **not deployed** anywhere
- The codebase is ready for OHIF integration once deployed

### 2.5 DICOMweb Endpoint

**Evidence:**
- `WADO_URL` environment variable exists
- `/api/pacs` routes proxy WADO-URI requests
- `EmbeddedWadoViewer` fetches frames via WADO-URI
- No native DICOMweb (WADO-RS) endpoint exists in the current API

**Assessment:**
- DICOMweb is **partially available** via WADO-URI proxy
- Full DICOMweb (WADO-RS) would require Orthanc or a dedicated DICOMweb server

### 2.6 ERP Launching Weasis

**Evidence:**
- `DicomViewer.tsx` page has viewer launch logic
- Can launch external viewers via URL protocols
- Configuration controlled by `PACS_VIEWER_TYPE`

**Assessment:**
- ERP **can launch Weasis** if configured correctly
- Requires correct `PACS_VIEWER_TYPE` and `WADO_URL` settings

### 2.7 PACS Configuration Production-Readiness

**Evidence:**
- `pacs_settings` table exists in database
- `dicom_nodes` table exists (modality configuration)
- `dicom_pull_jobs` table exists (job tracking)
- `radiology_worklist` table exists (worklist entries)

**Assessment:**
- Configuration is **database-driven** and production-ready
- Missing: `modality_routing_map` table (not in production)
- Missing: `mwl_entries` table (not in production)

### 2.8 Windows PC Dependencies

**Components Dependent on Windows PC:**
1. **Conquest PACS** — Running on `172.16.1.139`
2. **Weasis Viewer** — Installed on Windows PC
3. **DCMTK DICOM Puller** — Designed to run near modalities
4. **DICOM Modality Worklist** — May be generated by Windows software

**Components That Can Move to Synology:**
1. **Orthanc PACS** — Can run in Docker on Synology
2. **OHIF Viewer** — Can run in Docker on Synology
3. **DICOMweb** — Can be served by Orthanc on Synology
4. **ERP API** — Can run in Docker on Synology
5. **PostgreSQL** — Can run in Docker on Synology
6. **File Storage** — Synology NAS is ideal for this
7. **Backup Storage** — Synology NAS is ideal for this

### 2.9 PACS / DICOM Infrastructure Summary

| Component | Current Location | Can Move to Synology | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conquest PACS | Windows PC (172.16.1.139) | No (Windows-only) | Keep during transition |
| Orthanc PACS | Not deployed | Yes | Deploy on Synology |
| Weasis | Windows PC | No (desktop app) | Keep as backup viewer |

## PART 5 — ORTHANC + OHIF MIGRATION PLAN

### 5.1 Phase 1: Install Orthanc on Synology

**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Downtime:** None (parallel installation)

**Steps:**
1. Install Container Manager (Docker) on DSM 7+
2. Create `orthanc` folder in Docker shared folder
3. Create `orthanc.json` configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "Name": "CareDiagnostics",
     "StorageDirectory": "/var/lib/orthanc/db",
     "IndexDirectory": "/var/lib/orthanc/db",
     "DicomModalities": {
       "MRI": ["UIH", "172.16.1.10", 104],
       "CT": ["CT", "172.16.1.11", 104],
       "USG": ["USG", "172.16.1.12", 104]
     },
     "DicomAet": "CAREPACS",
     "DicomPort": 4242,
     "HttpPort": 8042,
     "RemoteAccessAllowed": true,
     "AuthenticationEnabled": true,
     "RegisteredUsers": {
       "admin": "secure-password-here"
     },
     "DicomWeb": {
       "Enable": true,
       "Root": "/dicom-web/",
       "EnableWado": true,
       "WadoRoot": "/wado/",
       "Host": "100.x.x.x"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Deploy Orthanc Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name orthanc \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 4242:4242 \
     -p 8042:8042 \
     -v /volume2/orthanc/db:/var/lib/orthanc/db \
     -v /volume2/orthanc/config:/etc/orthanc \
     jodogne/orthanc:latest
   ```
5. Verify Orthanc UI at `http://abinashnas:8042`
6. Test DICOM C-ECHO from a modality

### 5.2 Phase 2: Install OHIF on Synology

**Duration:** 1 day
**Downtime:** None

**Steps:**
1. Build OHIF with Synology-specific configuration:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   RUN apk add --no-cache git
   RUN git clone https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers.git .
   RUN yarn install
   ENV REACT_APP_CONFIG=/app/platform/app/public/config/default.js
   # Configure for Orthanc DICOMweb
   RUN yarn build
   
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY --from=builder /app/platform/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
   COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
   EXPOSE 3000
   ```
2. nginx.conf for OHIF:
   ```nginx
   server {
     listen 3000;
     location / {
       root /usr/share/nginx/html;
       try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
     }
     location /dicom-web/ {
       proxy_pass http://orthanc:8042/dicom-web/;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
     }
   }
   ```
3. Deploy OHIF container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name ohif \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     --link orthanc:orthanc \
     care-diagnostics/ohif:latest
   ```
4. Verify OHIF at `http://abinashnas:3000`

### 5.3 Phase 3: Parallel PACS Operation

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Downtime:** None

**Steps:**
1. Configure modalities to send to BOTH PACS systems:
   - Primary: Conquest (existing) — keep as-is
   - Secondary: Orthanc (new) — add as secondary destination
2. For each modality:
   - MRI: Add Orthanc as secondary DICOM node
   - CT: Add Orthanc as secondary DICOM node
   - USG: Add Orthanc as secondary DICOM node
3. Verify studies are arriving in both systems
4. Monitor Orthanc for any issues
5. Keep Conquest as the "source of truth" during this phase

### 5.4 Phase 4: Send Studies to Both PACS

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks (ongoing)
**Downtime:** None

**Configuration:**
- Each modality DICOM node configuration:
  ```
  Primary DICOM Server: Conquest (172.16.1.139:5678)
  Secondary DICOM Server: Orthanc (100.x.x.x:4242)
  ```
- Or use DICOM router on Synology to forward from Conquest to Orthanc

### 5.5 Phase 5: Validate Workflow

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Checklist:**
- [ ] Studies arrive in Orthanc (check count matches Conquest)
- [ ] Worklist generation works in Orthanc
- [ ] DICOMweb (WADO-RS) is accessible
- [ ] OHIF loads studies correctly
- [ ] ERP can launch OHIF for studies
- [ ] Reporting workflow is functional end-to-end
- [ ] Study search works in Orthanc
- [ ] Patient/study metadata is correct
- [ ] Image quality is preserved
- [ ] No data loss between Conquest and Orthanc

### 5.6 Phase 6: Retire Conquest

**Duration:** 1 day
**Downtime:** None (if properly planned)

**Prerequisites (ALL must be true):**
- [ ] Orthanc has 100% of studies from last 30 days
- [ ] All radiologists confirm OHIF is acceptable
- [ ] Worklist is fully operational on Orthanc
- [ ] ERP has been updated to point to Orthanc
- [ ] Backup of Conquest database exists
- [ ] 1 week of successful parallel operation

**Steps:**
1. Update modality configurations to remove Conquest
2. Update ERP `PACS_PROVIDER` to "orthanc"
3. Update `ORTHANC_URL` to Synology address
4. Update `OHIF_URL` to Synology address
5. Stop Conquest service (but keep data for 3 months)
6. Archive Conquest database to Synology

### 5.9 Storage Layout

| Volume | Purpose | Size | RAID |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volume 1 (Bays 1-2) | ERP + Docker | 4TB | RAID1 |
| Volume 2 (Bays 3-4) | PACS (Orthanc) | 8TB | RAID1 |
| Volume 3 (Bay 5) | Backups + Archive | 8TB | Single |

### 5.10 Backup Layout

| Source | Destination | Frequency | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orthanc DB | Volume 3 | Daily | Synology Snapshot |
| DICOM studies | Volume 3 | Daily | rsync |
| ERP database | Volume 3 | Hourly | pg_dump |
| Full system | External USB | Weekly | Hyper Backup |
| Full system | Cloud (S3) | Monthly | Hyper Backup |

### 5.11 Rollback Plan

**If Orthanc fails during validation:**
1. Keep Conquest running throughout parallel operation
2. Switch modalities back to Conquest-only (5 minutes)
3. Switch ERP `PACS_PROVIDER` back to "conquest" (1 minute)
4. Investigate and fix Orthanc issue
5. Re-attempt validation

**If data loss is detected:**
1. Stop Orthanc immediately
2. Compare study counts: Conquest vs Orthanc
3. Re-send missing studies from modalities
4. If needed, re-send from Conquest to Orthanc

**Worst case:**
- Conquest remains primary indefinitely
- Orthanc serves as secondary/archive only
- No disruption to clinical operations

## PART 6 — ERP MIGRATION FROM REPLIT TO SYNOLOGY

### 6.1 Database Migration Strategy

**Current State:**
- PostgreSQL on Replit (cloud-hosted)
- 3,724 patients, 3,615 bills
- Production schema: 226 tables (51 missing vs dev)

**Target State:**
- PostgreSQL in Docker on Synology
- All 277 tables (after schema sync)
- Full data integrity

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Pre-migration (on Replit):**
   ```bash
   # Fix schema drift first
   # Add missing columns to clinic_settings
   ALTER TABLE clinic_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ollama_base_url TEXT DEFAULT '';
   ALTER TABLE clinic_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ollama_model TEXT DEFAULT '';
   ALTER TABLE clinic_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ollama_local_only BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   
   # Create missing tables (or temporarily disable features)
   # Run all missing CREATE TABLE statements
   
   # Full backup
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > care-diagnostics-full-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

2. **Synology preparation:**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL container
   docker run -d \
     --name care-db \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=erp \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=STRONG_PASSWORD \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=diagnostic_erp \
     -v /volume1/docker/erp/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
     -p 5432:5432 \
     postgres:16-alpine
   
   # Wait for DB to be ready
   sleep 30
   ```

3. **Restore on Synology:**
   ```bash
   # Copy dump file to Synology
   scp care-diagnostics-full-20260607.sql admin@abinashnas:/volume1/docker/erp/
   
   # Restore
   docker exec -i care-db psql -U erp -d diagnostic_erp < care-diagnostics-full-20260607.sql
   ```

4. **Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Check table count
   docker exec care-db psql -U erp -d diagnostic_erp -c "SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';"
   
   # Check patient count
   docker exec care-db psql -U erp -d diagnostic_erp -c "SELECT count(*) FROM patients;"
   
   # Check bill count
   docker exec care-db psql -U erp -d diagnostic_erp -c "SELECT count(*) FROM bills;"
   ```

### 6.2 Upload Storage Migration

**Current:** Replit object storage (sidecar)
**Target:** Synology NAS shared folder

**Migration:**
```bash
# On Replit: export all uploaded files
# Files are in data/uploads/ or object storage

# On Synology:
mkdir -p /volume1/docker/shared/uploads

# Transfer via rsync
rsync -avz --progress \
  runner@replit-host:/path/to/uploads/ \
  admin@abinashnas:/volume1/docker/shared/uploads/

# Update ERP configuration to use local storage
# Modify objectStorage.ts or .env
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=/volume1/docker/shared/uploads/public
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=/volume1/docker/shared/uploads/private
```

### 6.3 File Storage Migration

**Current:** Replit ephemeral storage
**Target:** Synology persistent storage

**Files to migrate:**
- Patient photos (`data/uploads/photos/`)
- Scan documents (`data/uploads/scans/`)
- DICOM uploads (`data/uploads/dicom/`)
- Report exports (`data/exports/`)
- Backup files (`data/backups/`)

### 6.4 Environment Variables Migration

| Variable | Replit Value | Synology Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Replit URL | `postgres://erp:pass@care-db:5432/diagnostic_erp` | Docker internal |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | `production` | Same |
| `PORT` | `8080` | `8080` | Same |
| `SERVE_STATIC_DIR` | `artifacts/api-server/dist/web` | `/app/dist/web` | Docker path |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_USB_KEY` | Set | Set | Copy value |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Set | Set | Copy value |
| `AI_INTEGRATIONS_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Set | Set | Copy value |
| `ORTHANC_URL` | Not set | `http://care-orthanc:8042` | New |
| `ORTHANC_USERNAME` | Not set | `admin` | New |
| `ORTHANC_PASSWORD` | Not set | `secure-pass` | New |
| `OHIF_URL` | Not set | `http://abinashnas:3000` | New |
| `PACS_PROVIDER` | `conquest` | `orthanc` | Change after migration |
| `ENABLE_DICOM_PULL_AGENT` | Not set | `1` | Enable on Synology |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | Set | Set | Generate new strong key |
| `TZ` | `Asia/Kolkata` | `Asia/Kolkata` | Same |

### 6.5 SSL Strategy

**Option A: Tailscale + HTTPS (Recommended)**
- Tailscale provides automatic HTTPS certificates for all devices
- `https://abinashnas.tailnet-name.ts.net` — valid certificate
- No manual certificate management
- Works for all remote access scenarios

**Option B: Reverse Proxy with Let's Encrypt**
- Requires public domain and port 80/443 access
- More complex but works without Tailscale
- Use Synology's built-in reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt

**Option C: Self-Signed Certificates**
- Quick to set up
- Browser warnings for users
- Acceptable for internal use only

**Recommendation:** Use Tailscale + HTTPS (Option A) for all access. Add Synology reverse proxy for local clinic access without Tailscale.

### 6.6 Reverse Proxy Strategy

**nginx configuration for Synology:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name abinashnas.local;
    
    # ERP API
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://care-api:8080/api/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    # Clinic website
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://care-web:80/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    
    # ERP portal
    location /erp/ {
        proxy_pass http://care-web:80/erp/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    
    # Super admin
    location /super-admin-portal/ {
        proxy_pass http://care-web:80/super-admin-portal/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    
    # Orthanc
    location /pacs/ {
        proxy_pass http://care-orthanc:8042/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    
    # OHIF
    location /viewer/ {
        proxy_pass http://care-ohif:3000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

### 6.7 Docker Strategy

**Use existing `docker-compose.yml` from the repo:**

```yaml
# /volume1/docker/erp/docker-compose.yml
services:
  db:

    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    profiles: ["tools"]
    restart: "no"
```

### 6.8 Backup Strategy

- Tool: Synology Hyper Backup

### 6.9 Restore Strategy

**Database Restore (Point-in-Time):**
```bash
# Stop ERP
docker compose stop api

# Restore from backup
docker exec -i care-db psql -U erp -d diagnostic_erp < backup-file.sql

# Restart ERP
docker compose start api
```

**DICOM Studies Restore:**
```bash
# Stop Orthanc
docker stop care-orthanc

# Restore from snapshot
# Synology BTRFS snapshots can be browsed in File Station

# Or restore from backup
rsync -avz /volume3/backups/orthanc/ /volume2/orthanc/db/

# Restart Orthanc
docker start care-orthanc
```

**Full System Restore:**
1. Reinstall DSM on Synology (if hardware failure)
2. Restore from Hyper Backup
3. Reinstall Docker packages
4. Start containers
5. Verify all services

### 6.10 Disaster Recovery

2. RAID rebuilds automatically
3. If total failure: restore from Hyper Backup to new NAS
4. Estimated recovery time: 2-4 hours

**Scenario B: Database Corruption**
1. Stop ERP containers
2. Restore from latest valid pg_dump
3. Verify data integrity
4. Restart ERP
5. Estimated recovery time: 30 minutes

**Scenario C: Ransomware Attack**
1. Isolate NAS from network
2. Restore from offline backup (external USB)
3. Verify no encrypted files in backup
4. Rebuild and update all passwords
5. Estimated recovery time: 4-8 hours

**Scenario D: Complete Site Loss**
1. Procure new Synology DS1522+
2. Restore DSM from Hyper Backup cloud
3. Reinstall Docker containers
4. Restore database from cloud backup
5. Restore DICOM from cloud backup
6. Estimated recovery time: 1-2 days

### 6.11 ERP Migration Timeline

## PART 7 — AI ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### 7.1 Current AI Architecture

| Component | Current | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini AI | Replit AI Integration | Active, working |
| Ollama | Not deployed | Configured but no GPU |
| Local AI models | None | Not feasible on current hardware |
| AI features | Clinical notes, billing insights, patient communication | Working via Gemini |

### 7.2 Synology DS1522+ AI Capability

| Spec | Value | AI Impact |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen R1600 (2 cores) | Insufficient for LLMs |
| RAM | 8GB (expandable to 32GB) | Insufficient for model loading |
| GPU | None | Cannot run CUDA workloads |
| Storage | SATA HDD | Too slow for model I/O |

**Verdict:** Synology DS1522+ is **NOT suitable** for Ollama or any local LLM inference.

### 7.3 AI Options

**Option A: Keep Gemini on Replit (Recommended)**
- Continue using Gemini via Replit AI Integration
- No local hardware needed
- Works from any location (including Synology)
- Cost: Included in Replit plan
- **Recommendation:** Keep this as primary AI

**Option B: Ollama on Windows PC**
- Use existing Windows PC (asusi9clinic)
- CPU-only inference (slow)
- Limited to small models (3B-7B parameters)
- Good for: Quick drafts, simple text generation
- **Recommendation:** Use as secondary/offline AI

**Option C: Dedicated GPU Workstation**
- NVIDIA RTX 4060/4070 or better
- 32GB+ RAM
- SSD storage
- Cost: ~₹80,000-150,000
- Capable of: 7B-13B parameter models, image analysis, report generation
- **Recommendation:** Consider for future if AI becomes critical

**Option D: Cloud AI Services**
- OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, etc.
- No local hardware needed
- Pay per use
- **Recommendation:** Backup option if Gemini fails

### 7.4 Recommended AI Architecture

```
Primary AI: Gemini (via Replit AI Integration)
├─ Currently hosted: Replit
├─ Can be accessed from: Any location (Replit is cloud)
├─ Synology ERP can call: Same API endpoints
└─ No migration needed

Secondary AI: Ollama (on Windows PC)
├─ Host: asusi9clinic (Windows PC)
├─ Models: Small LLMs (3B-7B)
├─ Use case: Offline backup, quick drafts
├─ Access: Tailscale from Synology
└─ Keep running alongside Synology

Future AI: GPU Workstation (optional)
├─ Host: Dedicated machine
├─ Models: Large LLMs (7B-13B), vision models
├─ Use case: Advanced reporting, image analysis
├─ Access: Tailscale from Synology
└─ Timeline: 2027+ if needed
```

### 7.5 AI Migration Impact

**No migration needed for AI.** The Gemini integration is cloud-based and works regardless of where the ERP is hosted. The Synology ERP will continue calling the same Gemini API endpoints.

### 8.3 Remote Reporting Steps

**From Pune / Home / Travel:**
1. Connect device to Tailscale (auto-connects)
2. Open browser to `https://abinashnas.tailnet-name.ts.net/erp/`
3. Log in with staff credentials
4. Navigate to Reporting section
5. Studies are fetched from Orthanc (Synology) via DICOMweb
6. OHIF viewer loads in browser
7. Radiologist writes report in ERP
8. Report is saved to PostgreSQL (Synology)

**From Mobile:**
1. Open Tailscale app (auto-connects)
2. Open browser or mobile app
3. Log in with staff credentials
4. View reports, bills, appointments
5. Limited reporting (view-only recommended)

### 8.4 Security for Remote Reporting

| Layer | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Network | Tailscale (WireGuard) | Encrypted mesh, no open ports |
| Auth | Staff PIN + session | Existing ERP auth |
| HTTPS | Tailscale certificates | Auto-generated, valid |
| PACS | Orthanc auth | Username/password per user |
| DICOM | C-STORE only from LAN | Modalities cannot connect remotely |
| VPN | Required for all access | No public exposure |

### 8.5 Performance Considerations

| Activity | Bandwidth | Latency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ERP page load | 100KB | <100ms | Tailscale mesh is fast |
| Study list | 50KB | <100ms | API call |
| DICOM image (512x512) | 250KB | <100ms | OHIF loads progressively |
| DICOM image (2Kx2K) | 2MB | 200-500ms | May need compression |
| Report save | 10KB | <100ms | Instant |
| Video consult | 1Mbps | <200ms | Not currently supported |

**Recommendation:** For 3T MRI large series (1000+ slices), consider:
- OHIF progressive loading (built-in)
- Thumbnail-first loading
- Optional: Pre-generate JPEG2000 thumbnails

---

## PART 9 — SECURITY AUDIT

### 9.1 PACS Security

| Aspect | Current | Target | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conquest | No auth (LAN only) | Retire | Medium (LAN only) |
| Orthanc | Username/password | Same | Low |
| DICOM | C-STORE from LAN only | Same | Low |
| DICOMweb | Auth via Orthanc | Same | Low |
| OHIF | Auth via Orthanc | Same | Low |
| Tailscale | WireGuard encryption | Same | Low |

**Recommendation:**
- Orthanc should have strong admin password
- Enable Orthanc's `DicomWeb` with authentication
- Restrict DICOM C-STORE to LAN IPs only
- No public PACS exposure

### 9.2 ERP Security

| Aspect | Current | Target | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | Staff PIN + session | Same | Low |
| USB Gate | SUPER_ADMIN_USB_KEY | Same | Low |

## PART 10 — FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### 10.1 Executive Summary

Care Diagnostics has a **mature, production-ready ERP codebase** with 111 database schemas, 40+ frontend pages, and 30+ API modules. The system is well-architected for migration to Synology DS1522+.

**However, there are critical issues that must be resolved before migration:**

1. **CRITICAL:** Production database schema drift (51 missing tables, 3 missing columns) causes ERP failures
2. **HIGH:** PACS migration requires parallel operation (Conquest + Orthanc) to avoid downtime
3. **MEDIUM:** AI should remain cloud-based (Gemini); Synology cannot run local LLMs
4. **LOW:** Synology hardware is suitable for all workloads except AI

### 10.2 Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schema drift causes migration failure | High | High | Fix drift before migration |
| Data loss during PACS migration | Low | Critical | Parallel operation + backups |
| Synology hardware failure | Low | High | RAID + backups + spare drive |
| Network connectivity issues | Medium | Medium | Tailscale mesh is resilient |
| Staff resistance to change | Medium | Medium | Parallel operation + training |
| Ransomware attack | Low | Critical | Offline backups + snapshots |
| AI performance degradation | None | None | No AI migration needed |

### 10.3 Quick Wins

1. **Fix schema drift** (1 day) — Add missing columns to production
2. **Enable Tailscale on Synology** (already done)
3. **Install Orthanc on Synology** (1 day) — Start parallel PACS
4. **Configure OHIF** (1 day) — Test viewer
5. **Set up database backups** (1 day) — Synology Task Scheduler

### 10.4 Migration Priorities

| Priority | Activity | Duration | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Fix production schema drift | 1 day | None |
| P0 | Full production backup | 1 day | None |
| P1 | Deploy Orthanc on Synology | 2 days | None |
