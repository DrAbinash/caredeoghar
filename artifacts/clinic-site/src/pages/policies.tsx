        <PolicyBlock icon={<XCircle size={18} />} title="4. Cancellation Policy">
          <h4>4.1 Cancellation by Patient</h4>
          <p>A patient may request cancellation before the test is performed. Request may be made at reception or through official contact number, WhatsApp, email, or approved booking channel.</p>
          <p>For all patient-initiated cancellations: <strong>30% deduction applies</strong>. Balance 70% may be refunded after verification.</p>

          <h4>4.2 Cancellation After Slot Blocking</h4>
          <p>Once a slot, machine time, staff time, or consumable arrangement is blocked, cancellation attracts the standard 30% deduction.</p>

          <h4>4.3 No-Show Policy</h4>
          <p>If the patient does not report at the scheduled time and does not cancel in advance, the booking is treated as a <strong>No-Show</strong>. Refund may be denied. If approved in special circumstances, the 30% deduction applies.</p>

          <h4>4.4 Rescheduling</h4>
          <p>Rescheduling is allowed subject to availability. One rescheduling request may be allowed without deduction if made before the scheduled time and before the test process starts. Repeated or late rescheduling may be treated as cancellation with 30% deduction.</p>

          <h4>4.5 Cancellation by CARE DIAGNOSTICS</h4>
          <p>CARE DIAGNOSTICS may cancel due to machine breakdown, power failure, emergency priority, doctor unavailability, technical issues, safety concerns, natural calamity, or consumable non-availability. In genuine center-side cancellations, deduction may be waived and refund processed after management approval.</p>

          <h4>4.6 Cancellation Due to Patient Safety</h4>
          <p>If a test is cancelled because it is unsafe (allergy, pregnancy risk, implant issue, renal impairment, lack of consent), refund eligibility is decided by management considering expenses already incurred.</p>

          <h4>4.7 No Part Payment / No Dues</h4>
          <p>Full payment is mandatory before booking. Reports may not be released without full payment. Cancellation/refund is calculated on the amount actually paid.</p>
